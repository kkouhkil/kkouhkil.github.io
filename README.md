## Research Associate & Entrepreneurship Fellow

I am Research Associate (Post-doc) and Entrepreneurship Fellow at the University of Edinburgh. My aim of research is to give the robots the capability of moving out of their industrial cages and work in cooperation with humans in a shared-working environment whilst guaranteeing the safety of both humans and robots, by proposing controller algorithms that make them compliant and passive when they come to close interaction with humans/environment. Despite significant improvement in some specific applications like medical robotics, there is still the need for a general control framework that improves interaction robustness and motion dynamics.
