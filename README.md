## Research Associate & Entrepreneurship Fellow

I am a highly motivated and experienced Research Associate (Post-doc) and Entrepreneurship Fellow at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), with a strong background in robotics and control systems. My research interests lie in developing advanced control strategies for robots in general to safely collaborate with humans in shared work environments. The ultimate goal of my research is to provide robots with the capability to move beyond their traditional industrial settings and work in more dynamic and interactive tasks that cannot be fully characterized a priori, such as human-robot cooperation, polishing, and locomotion. My approach to achieving this goal involves proposing controller algorithms that enable robots to be compliant and passive during close interactions with humans and the environment, while also ensuring high performance. To achieve this, I use a combination of impedance control and passivity-based control techniques, which allow the robots to interact with uncertain environments within certain boundaries. The impedance control technique defines the relationship between the generated force by the robot and its location in its surrounding environment, while the passivity-based control ensures the safety and stability of the system by constraining the robot's behavior within certain limits. During my MSc and PhD studies, I worked extensively with various stationary-based and mobile-based robots, including the 7-DoF KUKA LWR 3 and Franka Emika. I evaluated my proposed algorithms using these robots and demonstrated their effectiveness in different scenarios. Although specific applications like medical robotics have seen significant improvement, a general control framework is still needed to improve interaction robustness and motion dynamics. Thus, my research is aimed at developing a general control framework that can be applied to different robotic platforms and scenarios, making robots more adaptable and reliable in a wide range of applications.
