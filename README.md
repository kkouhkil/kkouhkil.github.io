## Research Associate & Entrepreneurship Fellow

I am a highly motivated and experienced Research Associate (Post-doc) and Entrepreneurship Fellow at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), with a strong background in robotics and control systems. My research interests lie in developing advanced control strategies for robots in general to safely collaborate with humans in shared work environments. The ultimate goal of my research is to provide robots with the capability to move beyond their traditional industrial settings and work in more dynamic and interactive tasks that cannot be fully characterized a priori, such as human-robot cooperation, polishing, and locomotion. My approach to achieving this goal involves proposing controller algorithms that enable robots to be compliant and passive during close interactions with humans and the environment, while also ensuring high performance. To achieve this, I use a combination of impedance control and passivity-based control techniques, which allow the robots to interact with uncertain environments within certain boundaries. The impedance control technique defines the relationship between the generated force by the robot and its location in its surrounding environment, while the passivity-based control ensures the safety and stability of the system by constraining the robot's behavior within certain limits. During my MSc and PhD studies, I worked extensively with various stationary-based and mobile-based robots, including the 7-DoF KUKA LWR 3 and Franka Emika. I evaluated my proposed algorithms using these robots and demonstrated their effectiveness in different scenarios. Although specific applications like medical robotics have seen significant improvement, a general control framework is still needed to improve interaction robustness and motion dynamics. Thus, my research is aimed at developing a general control framework that can be applied to different robotic platforms and scenarios, making robots more adaptable and reliable in a wide range of applications.

    <td> <b> + Fractal impedance for passive controllers: a framework for interaction robotics: </b> <br>
    <p align="justify">
        There is increasing interest in control frameworks capable of moving robots from industrial cages to unstructured environments and coexisting with humans. Despite significant improvement in some specific applications (e.g., medical robotics), there is still the need for a general control framework that improves interaction robustness and motion dynamics. Passive controllers show promising results in this direction; however, they often rely on virtual energy tanks that can guarantee passivity as long as they do not run out of energy. In this paper, a Fractal Attractor is proposed to implement a variable impedance controller that can retain passivity without relying on energy tanks. The controller generates a Fractal Attractor around the desired state using an asymptotic stable potential field, making the controller robust to discretization and numerical integration errors. The results prove that it can accurately track both trajectories and end-effector forces during interaction. Therefore, these properties make the controller ideal for applications requiring robust dynamic interaction at the end-effector.

    <td> <b> + Robust High-Transparency Haptic Exploration for Dexterous Telemanipulation: </b> <br>
    <p align="justify">
        Robotic teleoperation provides human-in-the-loop capabilities of complex manipulation tasks in dangerous or remote environments, such as for planetary exploration or nuclear decommissioning. This work proposes a novel telemanipulation architecture using a passive Fractal Impedance Controller (FIC), which does not depend upon an active viscous component for guaranteeing stability. Compared to a traditional impedance controller in ideal conditions (no delays and maximum communication bandwidth), our proposed method yields higher transparency in interaction and demonstrates superior dexterity and capability in our telemanipulation test scenarios. We also validate its performance with extreme delays up to 1 s and communication bandwidths as low as 10 Hz. All results validate a consistent stability when using the proposed controller in challenging conditions, regardless of operator expertise.
